In this project, we tried to develop ML models to predict loan paying capabilties
PROJECT ABSTRACT

Our goal in this phase of the research is to increase the overall accuracy of our model by building on our past findings from Phase 1. The model built in Phase 1 had an accuracy of 73% on Kaggle, and given the drawbacks of not incorporating additional techniques in our model, we attempt to improve the quality of our dataset and thus our model by performing Feature Engineering, merging all of the datasets available in the Home Credit Default Risk dataset, and performing hyper-parameter tuning using GridSearchCV.The initial portion of Phase 2 is concerned with integrating all of the datasets accessible to us based on the primary key/combination of keys in the datasets. To monitor the progress of our dataset's quality, we perform exploratory data analysis on each dataset, such as heatmaps, correlation matrices, and missing number visualization, to better understand the important features in each dataset and to remove insignificant features based on missing value counts and highly correlated features. The second component of Phase 2 use the combined dataset to construct new characteristics in our dataset that we believe will increase the prediction potential of our model.Because they are highly linked with the target variable, these domain knowledge characteristics are effective in attempting to improve the model's quality. The final phase of Phase 2 focuses on creating pipelines and adjusting hyperparameters with GridSearchCV in order to integrate the most important in our model.We then predict on our final dataset using Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms thereby improving the accuracy to 92.1% which was 93.15 before and on Kaggle ~73%.
